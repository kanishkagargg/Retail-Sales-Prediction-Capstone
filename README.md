# Retail-Sales-Prediction-Capstone

The project titled "Retail Sales Prediction" aims to leverage machine learning techniques to forecast sales in retail stores based on a comprehensive dataset. The dataset encompasses various parameters, including store type, assortment, sales, customer footfall, date, competition distance, promotional activities, and state or school holidays.

## Objective:
The primary goal of the project is to develop an accurate and reliable model for predicting retail sales. This predictive capability can empower retailers to optimize inventory, staffing, and promotional strategies, leading to improved overall business performance.

## Key Data Columns:
The dataset contains essential columns such as store type, assortment, sales, customer footfall, date, competition distance, promo status, and information on state or school holidays. These variables will be crucial in understanding the factors influencing retail sales and building an effective predictive model.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Before feeding the data into machine learning models, a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted. This involves understanding the characteristics of the dataset, identifying patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables. Visualizations will play a crucial role in gaining insights into the data distribution and trends. The data preprocessing phase handles missing values, outliers, and ensure that the dataset is in a suitable format for modeling. Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

## Machine Learning Models:
The prepared data is fed into several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting. Each model offers unique advantages in capturing different aspects of the data. The variety of models aims to ensure flexibility and robustness in predicting retail sales. Hyperparameter tuning is employed to optimize the performance of these models, enhancing their accuracy and generalization capabilities.

## Model Comparison and Selection:
After training the machine learning models, their performance is evaluated using relevant metrics. This evaluation enables a comparison of the models to identify the one that best suits the specific requirements of the retail sales prediction task. The chosen model, which is XGBoost Regressor, is the one demonstrating the highest accuracy and reliability in predicting sales based on the given dataset.
